# Configurations

`express-cli` and `matic-cli` use these config files to bootstrap the devnet.
In case of `express-cli`, these configs are dynamically changes based on the `.env` file.
For `mati-cli`, the configs are directly used to spin the network up.

## Usage

```bash
matic-cli setup devnet --config path/to/config.yaml
```

## Option details with examples

```yaml
# Default stake for each validator (in matic)
defaultStake: 10000

# Default amount of fee to topup heimdall validator
